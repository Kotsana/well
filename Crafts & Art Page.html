<p>Above are some of the crafts of Basotho, beautifully carved and handcrafted:<br>
	<article>
<ul>
	<li>Image one shows the national symbol that's unmistakeable from far.Also know as the <b>Mokorotlo</b> crafted<br> dozens of years ago to represent Basotho and to protect them against the scortching burn of the sun.</li>
	<li>Image two contains multiple object/crafts but notably we will be talking about the grass baskets. Crafted <br>to perfection with one aim being to help around and outside the house in carrying light-weight material <br>that come in numbers.</li>
	<li>Image three shows pottery, though the patterns are modern but the art is ancient and has been practiced <br>by cultures around Africa from as early as three decades or even before that.</li>
	<li>Image four showcases the Lebetlela, a tool or rather used as a weapon or part if the arsenal for many displays<br> of Basotho.A few are the play: Ho kalla, mainly played by herd boys or Bashemane to sharpen their battle <br>skills and keenness and to unbore themselves when still herdling cows, sheep and other animals.</li>
